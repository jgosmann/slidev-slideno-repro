Minimal reproduction of all slides showing the same 'current' page number.
During a transition both slides show the same number, i.e. it changes on the
current slide before the transition.

This repo was created with `npm init slidev@latest` and only the slides have
been edited to show `<SlideCurrentNo />`.
